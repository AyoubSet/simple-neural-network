# Simple Neural Network Visualization

This project is based on a university assignment and focuses on
visualizing a simple shallow neural network using graphs.

The visualizations illustrate:
- The relationship between the outputs of the hidden layer perceptrons
  and the final network output
- The effect of the final layer bias on the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
  with respect to the expected results

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Perceptron
- Shallow Neural Networks
- Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
- Bias influence on loss

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
python main.py
